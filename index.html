        <h1>What is 'Technology and Society'?</h1>
        <p>We are living in a time when rapid technological developments are causing profound changes at all levels of society. 
            Each and every profession is affected in some significant way, and because of this, the labour market’s demand for digital competence is increasing. This course - ‘Technology and Society’ - is developed to meet this demand.


        <h2>Working in groups</h2>
        <p>Group work in this course has two functions.

            First, and most importantly, working together, being exposed to the opinions of others, and having one’s ideas challenged is one of the main learning objectives of this course. Given the number of students, this is only achievable through work in smaller groups with close supervision of from teaching assistants.
            
            Second, the case, or problem-based nature of the obligatory assignments in this course lend themselves naturally to group discussions, and preferably discussions in which a final agreement is difficult to obtain. In the obligatory assignments we are not looking for final, or the right answers, but that you are able to discuss as single case or problem from a multiplicity of vantage points and tensions.</p>

        <h1>Plan'it. </h1>
        <p>Plan'it" is a website that allows employees to book a table in an office landscape, and provides notifications when the time for their booking is approaching and when the time is up. 
            The "Plan'it" website shows a map of which places in the office have tables available for booking, clicking on the table.
            <h2>Its function</h2>
        <p>This idea is well thought out and easy to use. We have tried to make it as simple as possible so that it is not necessary to spend a lot of time making a booking. 
            At the same time, the lights to be placed on the tables have very low costs, and are not dangerous for the environment. 
            They also make it easy for everyone in the office to see if a table is available or occupied.
            It may be that there are some who think this is difficult, even though we have tried to make it easy.</p>
